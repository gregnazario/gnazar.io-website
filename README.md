### Why make this project?
This was a project to build my previous personal website entirely over in React to learn React.  It's the technology
well liked in Frontend, so why not learn it!

It may have a lot of mistakes and not-quite there usages, as a programmer I am pretty novice to
JavaScript/React in general, but it seems to work pretty much alright.

### Known issues
1. Collapsed navbar lists items horizontally instead of vertically

### Future plans

- Blogging will be handled via https://blog.gnazar.io
- Add Photos and other projects to the website
- Maybe an in-browser game?
