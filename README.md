### Why make this project?
This was a project to build my previous personal website entirely over in React to learn React.  It's the technology
well liked in Frontend, so why not learn it!

It may have a lot of mistakes and not-quite there usages, as a programmer I am pretty novice to
JavaScript/React in general, but it seems to work pretty much alright.

### Known issues
1. Mobile "collapsed" navbar does not work properly, and when expanded all nav items are on top of each other

### Future plans

I want to add a blog on my personal website, as well as add some extra personal projects that I've collected
over the years.  Possibly, even add an in browser game to the mix.
